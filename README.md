# Node.js Training

To better develop my skill set, both professionally and personally, I am currently working with Node.js to learn more. 

# What are these files?

These are just personal files I've created whilst developing a better understanding of Node.js, what it can be used for and how I can implement my learning into future projects and development.

The comments in the code are just things I've written whilst learning to aid in my further development, add clarity and offer insight into why something is there or what it's for.
